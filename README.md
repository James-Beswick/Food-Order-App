# Food-Order-App
A practice react app using custom hooks and react context

Technology Used:
1. React
2. CSS
3. Firebase Realtime Database

This app is a dummy frontend for a food ordering site, mainly focussed on creating custom UI components. I make use of my own custom form hook and calls
to a Firebase Realtime Database for GETing and POSTing orders and customer details.
